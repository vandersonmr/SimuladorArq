The specification of the architecture can be found with the source code. In this program you can enter with a assembly code (In the specification) and using the mont pass it to hexdecimal and run in the simulator. You also can run step by step and analyze the values in the registers, memory and/or in the pipeline stages.\r\nThis simulator is on freeBSD license.  \r\nYou can fork this project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was developed by Vanderson M. do Rosario and Jo√£o Almeida de Jesus Junir, both sophomore of computer science. Now available open source and hosted in github. Anyone can help us to improve this simulator or use it. This project was developed in 2012. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can send us a email in vandersonmr2@gmail.com or joao29a@gmail.com.","google":""}
